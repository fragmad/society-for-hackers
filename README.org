#+TITLE: Social Sciences and Cultural Studies for Hackers

* Introduction 

One of the greatest problems facing the tech industry is a poor understanding of social sciences and the humanaties. As technologists we have the capacity to solve many problems with powerful tools which can change the world for the better. But as a field we are almost always blind to the approches and knowlege gained from the social sciences and the humanities. These areas of knoweldge are vital to help us understand the consiquences of our work. 

Below are tables of books and resources for Hackers who want to spend sometime studying culture, so they are better prepared to not do evil.

This is a small personal project aimed to curate a reading list for my own education. 

However I take contributions seriously and welcome them. To that end a code of conduct will be included in a forthcoming contribution guide. If anyone wishes to contribute but feels unable due to my decision to use GitHub as the primary distribution tool please contact me for assistance.
